# Contraction of `ITensorMap` networks.
#
# `contract` matches legs by `(id, plev)`, builds `ncon`'s integer label lists
# (contracted → positive, open → negative with magnitude fixing the output order), and
# dispatches to TensorOperations' dynamic `ncon`. The contraction order is taken from a
# `sequence` (a pairwise tree of tensor positions, see contraction_sequences.jl) — either
# supplied by the caller or computed by `contraction_sequence(...; alg)` (default
# `"optimal"`) — and flattened into `ncon`'s elimination `order` by `_contraction_order`.
# Depends on `ITensorMap`/`unsafe_itensormap`/`inds` from itensor.jl and
# `contraction_sequence` from contraction_sequences.jl.

    contract(t1::ITensorMap, ts::ITensorMap...; sequence=nothing, alg="optimal", kwargs...)

Contract a network of tensors over their shared legs (matched by `(id, plev)`),
returning an `ITensorMap` carrying the open legs (those appearing on a single tensor)
in first-appearance order. `*` is the binary alias.

A leg shared by two tensors is summed; a leg appearing once is left open.
An index shared by more than two tensors (a hyperedge) is unsupported.
Dispatches to TensorOperations' dynamic `ncon`, which handles the permutes/recoupling;
contracted legs must be mutually dual (an invariant of the bond orientation).

The contraction order is the `sequence` (a pairwise tree of tensor positions); if
`nothing`, it is computed via [`contraction_sequence`](@ref) with the given `alg`.
The other keywords are passed on to `ncon`.
